# Me IRL Twitter Bot
im a twitter bot made in javascript that fetches the latest posts from the /r/me_irl reddit.

## Disclaimer
Abusing this script can get you banned from twitter if you set it to such a low delay, therefor why I keep it as 30 minutes per tweet.

## Dependencies
This twitter bot was creating in javascript with nodejs which you can install at https://nodejs.org. The actual bot depends on the npm packages <b>twitter</b>, <b>snekfetch</b>, <b>moment</b>, <b>chalk</b>, <b>fs</b> and <b>request-promise-native</b>

# Setting it Up
It's pretty easy if you know what you're doing.

## Usage
Once everything is setup all all you'll need to do is run `node index.js`
